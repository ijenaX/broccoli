## FAQ

### Why Can Some Recipes Not Be Imported via Their URL Into Broccoli?
Broccoli searches for recipe metadata in the [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) format. Many modern sites and blogs provide this metadata since it helps them with search engine optimization. But some might also choose to not expose it because they do not want any external sites and tools to scrape their content.

If you want to verify if a specific site exposes JSON-LD metadata hit F12 in your browser and search for script tags with the `type="application/ld+json"` property.

### Can I Import Recipes From Text Files Into Broccoli?
Broccoli can only import it's own backup files (which can be created via "Backup & Restore"). But if you are technical adept and have some scripting skills you can create a `broccoli-archive` file yourself.

The `broccoli-archive` is basically a zip file which consists of other zip files (one `broccoli` file for each recipe) and a JSON file for the categories. Each `broccoli` file consists of an optional image file and a JSON file with describes the recipe's metadata. Create an export yourself and have a look at the resulting file.

The following task have to be done:
1. Create the JSON file for each recipe (depending on the structure of your text files)
2. Zip this file (with an optional image file) into a `broccoli` file
3. Create a JSON file which describes your categories (in case you have any)
4. Zip the JSON and all the `broccoli` files into a `broccoli-archive`
5. Import the `*.broccoli-archive` into Broccoli
